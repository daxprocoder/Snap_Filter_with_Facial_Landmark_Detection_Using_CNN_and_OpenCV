# Snap_Filter_with_Facial_Landmark_Detection_Using_CNN_and_OpenCV
This project implements a real-time facial landmark detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV's Haar Cascade for face detection. The system predicts 30 key facial landmarks, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, and overlays visual effects like glasses. GPU acceleration ensures real-time performance.
